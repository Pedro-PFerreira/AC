## Project Description

- Basketball tournaments are usually split in two parts. First, all teams play each other aiming to achieve the greatest number of wins possible. Then, at the end of the first part of the season, a pre determined number of teams which were able to win the most games are qualified to the playoff season, where they play series of knock-out matches for the trophy.

- For the 10 years, data from players, teams, coaches, games and several other metrics were gathered and arranged on this dataset. 

- The goal is to use this data to predict which teams will qualify for the playoffs in the next season.

## Business Understanding

### Business Objectives

- Our goal is to predict correctly which teams will classify to the playoffs in the next season, by creating a predictive model that uses that data given.

### Assess Situation

- Since we are beginning to work (20/09/2023) on this project, we don't have any previous knowledge about the data, so we will have to explore it and understand it before we can start working on it.


### Determine Data Mining Goals

- Since we are beginning to work (20/09/2023) on this project,we can't define in this moment clear objectives to achive with our data mining model.

### Produce Project Plan

- We're planning our project in this way:

1) Study Data

2) Convert Data (CSV to SQL)

3) Data Exploration

4) Data Preparation

5) Data Modelling

6) Evaluation

7) Deployment
